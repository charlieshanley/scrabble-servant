# Scrabble Servant

A web API to suggest scrabble letters given your seven tiles.

### To provision development environment with nix

`nix-shell --attr env release.nix`

In this nix-shell, you can use cabal, ghcid, etc.

For more info, see Gabriel Gonzalez's [tutorial](https://github.com/Gabriel439/haskell-nix/)

Note that `scrabble-servant.nix` is derived from `scrabble-servant.cabal` via
`cabal2nix`.
